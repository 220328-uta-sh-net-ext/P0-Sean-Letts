## Project Requirements

## Building/Developing the product

## Todo for the project
- Logging in/logging out functionality
- People can draw a pokemon in the website (canvas)
- They can go in blind (no image assistance) or with an image to look at
- When they’re done, compare the drawing to the sprite (front version) 
- Socket.io for a competitive gaming aspect where player 1 draws the pokemon and player 2 guesses what it is, and if it’s right player 1 wins a point. 
- Display information on the pokemon
- Save the images drawn by the user to the DB
- (Users can download their image to their computer?)
- Display all drawings by rating or time stamp
- Allow users to rate drawings
